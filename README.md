## Roku

**Roku platform overview**
Roku is the leading TV streaming platform in the U.S. We connect users to the streaming content they love, enable content publishers to build and monetize large audiences, and provide advertisers with unique capabilities to engage consumers.

With active accounts reaching 46 million by the fall of 2020, Roku's reach is comparable to the largest cable providers in the United States. Roku users streamed a record 40.3 billion hours in 2019. Per household streaming on the Roku platform averages roughly 3.5 hours a day per active account in 2019, representing nearly half of average U.S. per-household daily viewing.

TV viewing is shifting to streaming platforms. Roku is well positioned to help content publishers with a sophisticated suite of tools that make it easy to distribute and monetize content. The Roku Developer Program empowers content publishers to build Roku streaming channels, regardless of technical expertise. Use Direct Publisher to build a Roku streaming channel without writing a single line of code or invest in a customized streaming experience based on our developer SDK.
